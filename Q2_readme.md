# Q4 readme

make sure you can open the ipynb file from the jupyter notebook

## reference code
[source 1 apriori](https://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/user_guide/frequent_patterns/apriori/)
[source 2 apriori alg](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48482444/extracting-elements-from-frozenset)
[source 3 FPTree](https://github.com/RohiBaner/FPTree/blob/master/FPTree-Python3.py)

##package demo
open file *package demo.ipynb*, click *Kernel* then click *Restart & Run All*
The result of the 7th box shows the frequent itemsets with min-support 10
This part does not belong to task 1 and 2, just run.

## Task 1
open file *apriori.ipynb*, click *Kernel* then click *Restart & Run All*
This file is the apriori algorithm I make to solve this problem. The dataset is too large to give the output

open file *FP-tree.ipynb*, click *Kernel* then click *Restart & Run All*
This code is changed from github, but I can't build the fp-tree alg.
