# Q2 readme
make sure you can open the ipynb file from the jupyter notebook

## Task 1
In this part, I use the SVC package from sklearn
open file *Q2-task1.ipynb*, click *Kernel* then click *Restart & Run All*
The 7th box shows the accuracy of the SVC, which is the result of the task 1.

## Task 2
Try to solve the classification problem manually

### Task 2 baseline
open file *Q2-task2-baseline.ipynb*, click *Kernel* then click *Restart & Run All*
The 5th box is the accuracy of the Logistic Regression Model. This model is imported from the sklearn package.

### Task 2 manually

open file *mannually.ipynb*, click *Kernel* then click *Restart & Run All*
In this part, the manually code is changed by [Machine Learning](https://github.com/FlorianMuellerklein/Machine-Learning/blob/master/LogisticClassifier.py)
In the third box, the output is the accuracy of this model.
In this part, the running time is very long(about 5-6 minutes)

## Small Try (Not in task1 and 2)
This code don't belong to task 1 and task 2.
open file *mean square error.ipynb*, click *Kernel* then click *Restart & Run All*
In this part, I want to try linear regression to solve this problem. Calculate the MSE.
linear regression can't solve this classification problem.
