# Q5 readme
make sure you can open the ipynb file from the jupyter notebook
## Data Preprocessing
In this part, I use the datetime and timedelta package from datetime. I use the StandardScaler package from sklearn.
open file *Data_Preprocessing.ipynb*, click *Kernel* then click *Restart & Run All*
The 8th box's output shows the rank of Top 20 features which has the lasrgest correctation score.
The 9th box shows the visualization of their number by using the day time.

## Task 1
In this part, I use the PolynomialFeatures&LinearRegression package from sklearn
open file *linear+poly.ipynb*, click *Kernel* then click *Restart & Run All*
The 3rd box shows the feature I use in this problem.
The 4th box shows the mse of each stock.
The 5th box shows the visualization of this mse

## Task 2
Try to solve the problem by using the linear regression model. These are the source I use in this task.

[source 3](https://www.python-engineer.com/courses/mlfromscratch/04_linearandlogisticregression/)

open file *Q5_task2.ipynb*, click *Kernel* then click *Restart & Run All*
The 3rd box shows the features I use in this problem. They are chosen from task1.
The 5th box shows the model I use in this part. This model use the source I listed before.
The 7th box shows the mse of all stocks.
