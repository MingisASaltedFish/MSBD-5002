## Task 1
open file *without_adam.ipynb*, click *Kernel* then click *Restart & Run All*
The 3rd box shows the algorithm I write for this problem.
The 4th box shows some results I make to solve the problem
The 5th box shows the result of the hyperparameter I choose.
The 7th box shows the visualization of this F-norm 

## Task 2
The 8th box shows the adopted Hit Ratio@{10,50,100} 

## Adam try
open file *adam-fail.ipynb*, click *Kernel* then click *Restart & Run All*
In this task, I want to use the adam optimizer to make the function better. However, this try is not good becasue of the f-norm is not decrease in 200 iterations.
