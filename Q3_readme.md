# Q3 readme

make sure you can open the ipynb file from the jupyter notebook

##package demo
open file *package demo.ipynb*, click *Kernel* then click *Restart & Run All*
The result of the 7th box shows the frequent itemsets with min-support 10
This part does not belong to task 1 and 2, just run.

## Task 1
open file *apriori.ipynb*, click *Kernel* then click *Restart & Run All*
This file is the apriori algorithm I make to solve this problem. The dataset is too large to give the output

open file *FP-tree.ipynb*, click *Kernel* then click *Restart & Run All*
This code is the fail try of FP-tree. In This part, I fail to build the algorithm by my own
Then, I change the source from Github and get a runable code. The result is from
